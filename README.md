## Original Exercise Instructions
Build a simple react app which displays a list of people from the Star Wars API - https://swapi.co/documentation.

**The app should**:
- Render any number of people into a table
- The table should be sortable (ascending or descending) by some dimension of the data (date, name, whatever you like)
- Should be possible to click on a person and see more details
- Should be possible to save people to a ‘favourites’ list
- Be laid out nicely
- Preferrably built in React, but state can be managed in any way.
